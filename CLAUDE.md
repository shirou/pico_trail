## Mandatory Pre-Work Verification Process

**⚠️ For ALL work, the following MUST be completed before starting any task:**

### Required Checklist

- [ ] CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md have been re-read
- [ ] Relevant template documents have been reviewed (docs/templates/)
- [ ] Existing similar documents have been referenced to understand format
- [ ] Project-specific standards > general knowledge priority has been confirmed

### Additional Verification for Documentation Tasks

- [ ] Applicable template has been read and loaded first
- [ ] Template structure is being followed completely
- [ ] Completed work has been re-verified against template compliance

**If this verification process is skipped, immediately STOP work and report to the user.**
**When uncertain or unclear about anything, do NOT interpret independently - always confirm with the user.**

### Rationale

Ignoring project-established documentation standards invalidates the team's entire documentation effort and destroys quality consistency. Prioritizing project-specific standards over general knowledge is essential for collaborative development.

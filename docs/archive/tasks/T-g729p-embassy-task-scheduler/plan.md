## Overview

Implement Embassy-based task scheduler for periodic task execution at configurable rates (1Hz-400Hz) with task monitoring, CPU load tracking, and real-time performance guarantees for autopilot control loops.

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Tasks execute within 5% of target period over 10-second window
- [ ] Control loop latency ≤ 20ms (NFR-ukjvr)
- [ ] IMU sampling rate = 400Hz ± 5% (NFR-3wlo1)
- [ ] Scheduler overhead < 5% CPU
- [ ] Zero deadline misses under 75% CPU load
- [ ] All existing tests pass; no regressions

## Scope

- Goal: Implement production-ready task scheduler using Embassy async framework
- Non-Goals:
  - RTIC implementation (deferred, see ADR-vywkw)
  - Dynamic task registration (compile-time only for now)
  - Multi-core scheduling (future enhancement)
  - Full GUI monitoring (telemetry output only)
- Assumptions:
  - Platform abstraction layer exists (completed in T-egg4f)
  - Embassy crates are stable (v0.2+ for `embassy-rp`)
  - Hardware timer available on both RP2040 and RP2350
- Constraints:
  - `no_std` environment
  - < 5% CPU overhead requirement
  - < 10 KB RAM budget for scheduler
  - Must work on both RP2040 (Cortex-M0+) and RP2350 (Cortex-M33)

## ADR & Legacy Alignment

- [x] ADR-vywkw-task-scheduler-selection governs this work
- [x] No legacy code conflicts (greenfield implementation)
- [x] Platform abstraction (T-egg4f) provides timer interface

## Plan Summary

- Phase 1 – Core scheduler infrastructure (types, registry, statistics)
- Phase 2 – Task execution and monitoring (Embassy tasks, measurement, CPU load)
- Phase 3 – Hardware validation and optimization (deploy, benchmark, tune)

### Phase Status Tracking

Mark checkboxes (`[x]`) immediately after completing each task or subtask. If an item is intentionally skipped or deferred, annotate it (e.g., strike-through with a brief note) instead of leaving it unchecked.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we use hardware timer registers directly instead of platform abstraction for timing measurement to minimize overhead? → Next step: Implement with platform abstraction first, profile, optimize only if needed
- [ ] Is exponential moving average sufficient for statistics, or should we add full history for debugging? → Method: Start with EMA, add optional full history only if users need it
- [ ] Should we add dynamic task registration API, or is compile-time sufficient? → Decision: Defer dynamic registration to future task, keep compile-time only for v1 (simpler, zero overhead)
- [ ] How to handle task panics? → Next step: Add panic handler logging, document expected behavior (system halt)

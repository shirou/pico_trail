## Context

<!-- What problem or architecturally significant requirement motivates this decision? Include constraints, assumptions, scope boundaries, and prior art. Keep value-neutral and explicit. -->

- What problem are we solving?
- What constraints/assumptions apply?
- What forces are in tension?
- What pain points or limitations exist?

## Success Metrics (optional)

<!-- Define measurable criteria to evaluate if this decision was successful -->

- Metric 1: `[what to measure, e.g., "API response time < 200ms"]`
- Metric 2: `[target value, e.g., "Error rate < 1%"]`
- Metric 3: `[qualitative measure, e.g., "Developer feedback positive"]`

## Decision

<!-- State the decision clearly in active voice. Start with "We will..." or "We have decided to..." and describe the core rules, policies, or structures chosen. Include short examples if clarifying. -->

### Decision Drivers (optional)

- `[criterion 1]`
- `[criterion 2]`

### Considered Options (optional)

- Option A: <name>
- Option B: <name>
- Option C: <name>

### Option Analysis (optional)

- Option A — Pros: <…> | Cons: <…>
- Option B — Pros: <…> | Cons: <…>
- Option C — Pros: <…> | Cons: <…>

## Rationale

<!-- Explain why this decision was made. Tie back to drivers and context. Be explicit about trade-offs and why alternatives were not chosen. -->

## Consequences

### Positive

- `[benefit 1]`
- `[benefit 2]`

### Negative

- `[cost/limitation 1]`
- `[cost/limitation 2]`

### Neutral (if useful)

- `[neutral effect or caveat]`

## Implementation Notes (optional)

- High-level plan, phases, or priority for adopting the decision.
- Interfaces/CLI/UX conventions (args, flags, exit codes) if part of the decision.
- Storage paths, data models, and error handling patterns (reference KopiError/ErrorContext if applicable).

## Examples (optional)

```bash
# Example commands or usage that illustrate the decision
kopi <command> `[args]`
```

```rust
// Code/pseudocode illustrating core mechanics
```

## Platform Considerations (required if applicable)

- Unix/Windows/filesystem behavior, libc variants, architectures, and any auto-detection or compatibility handling.

## Security & Privacy (required if applicable)

- Sensitive data handling, logging limitations, threat considerations.

## Monitoring & Logging (required if applicable)

- Verbosity model, environment variables, diagnostics guidance, and observability hooks.

## Open Questions

- [ ] `[Question that needs investigation]`
- [ ] `[Decision that needs to be made]` → Next step: `[Where to resolve (e.g., refine requirements docs/requirements/FR-<id>-<capability>.md, develop design docs/tasks/T-<id>-<task>/design.md per TDL)]`
- [ ] `[Information that needs gathering]` → Method: `[How to obtain insight]`
